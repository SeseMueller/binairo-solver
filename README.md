# binairo-solver

Grabs a random puzzle with the given size from https://www.puzzle-binairo.com and solves it. 
In order to make it work with different sizes, change the mode at the beginning of the main file.

Doesn't support monthly puzzle, because it isn't square.

This Repository was written in an afternoon and helped me learn Rust.
